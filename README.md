# VBA Refactoring Analysis

## Overview

I have a friend named Steve. And while I've already built a button-loaded worksheet for my friend to analyze the performance of green energy stocks during 2018-2019, still he wants more. Steve wants to analyze performance of all the stocks from 2018-2019. The goal is to refactor the code so that the script runs faster and can handle an expanded dataset.
