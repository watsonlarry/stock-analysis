# VBA Refactoring Analysis

## Overview

I have a friend named Steve. And while I've already built a button-loaded worksheet for my friend to analyze the performance of green energy stocks during 2018-2019, still he wants more. Steve wants to analyze performance of all the stocks from 2018-2019. The goal is to refactor the code so that the script runs faster and can handle an expanded dataset. Secondary goal: convince Steve to compensate me for all this work--I mean how close are we?

### Sumarry
1. Refactoring code can have many advantages. By simplifying the code you make it easier to reuse, modify, or even return to (if some time passes between you and a project). By making the code more elegant and easier to read, your code becomes more welcoming to others. If you're planning on passing off your code to a partner, or giving it to others to use, readability is helpful. There are risks though. Anytime you attempt to modify already working code, you risk 
2. The primary goal was a success, the refactored script runs faster. Thus, one advantage to refactoring is immediatly apparent: you can increase the processing speed.
